abstract = {Abstract We consider a nonconforming hp-finite element approximation of a variational formulation of the time-harmonic Maxwell equations with impedance boundary conditions proposed by Costabel et al. The advantages of this formulation is that the variational space is embedded in H1 as soon as the boundary is smooth enough (in particular it holds for domains with an analytic boundary) and standard shift theorem can be applied since the associated boundary value problem is elliptic. Finally in order to perform a wavenumber explicit error analysis of our problem, a splitting lemma and an estimation of the adjoint approximation quantity are proved by adapting to our system the results from Melenk and Sauter obtained for the Helmholtz equation. Some numerical tests that illustrate our theoretical results are also presented. Analytic regularity results with bounds explicit in the wavenumber of the solution of a general elliptic system with lower order terms depending on the wavenumber are needed and hence proved.},
